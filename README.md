# CTF-Bot (for CatN1p!)

This is a CTF management bot containing features I personally find necessary or useful. It was originally created for the CatN1p hacking team, but anyone can use it!

## Architecture Overview

The project is split into two runtimes:

- `bot/`: Discord bot that exposes slash commands, runs inside the provided container or any Node.js environment.
- `revshell/`: Reverse shell relay service (Express REST API + TCP bridge). It now runs alongside the bot through the root `docker-compose.yml`, assuming the reverse-shell TCP port (default `3000`) is reachable from your Tailscale network or other tunnel.

### Reverse Shell Flow

1. Users run `/revshell create` from Discord.
2. The bot calls the external revshell REST API (HTTP 8000) to create a pairing.
3. Operators/targets connect to the revshell TCP listener (port 3000) to bridge shells.
4. Additional `/revshell status` and `/revshell close` commands use the same REST API.

### Deployment Notes

- Copy `env.example` to `.env` and populate the required secrets before running `docker compose up`.
- Ensure the listener port you expose (`REVSHELL_TCP_PORT`, defaults to `3000`) is reachableâ€”for example, advertise your Tailscale hostname via `REVSHELL_ACCESS_HOSTNAME`.
- `REVSHELL_HTTP_PORT` controls the host port used to reach the revshell REST API (defaults to `8000`).
- Adjust `REVSHELL_HTTP_BASE_URL`/`REVSHELL_TCP_HOST` if you deploy the revshell service somewhere other than the bundled container.
